# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Your Task

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.


## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```


# challanges

Challenges repository
This is an open source project which has Licensed by MIT which allow you to contribute and used open source codes used in this repo (All Branches).
More info: https://g.co/kgs/QWcHhF

  - Branches are named as module[n] and each one of them its unique challenge.
  - Master Branch contain the last solved challenge. (the read me your are reading trough, it is a defult guid when NO challage availabel to help you do a pre-setup.)
  
 # how to use the module and deploy
 
  - Clone the repo and make it own
      # Https url : 
          git clone https://github.com/miladesmailpour/challanges.git
      # ssh url :
          git clone git@github.com:miladesmailpour/challanges.git
      # Checking the fetch/pull and push url : 
          git remote -v
      # Modifing origin url : 
          git remote add origin [https/ssh url of you repo] https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo
      # Verifing the fetch/pull and push url : 
          git remote -v https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories
      # Chacking the status of local : 
          git status
          
          "if local NOT updated"
          git add .
          git commit -m "[your comment]"
          git push origin master/main
   
   - Checkout to the module (the challenge you want to used and deploy)
      # Checkout to the disred challage : 
          git checkout module[n]
      # Verifing : 
          git status
      # [Make the change you wish to have]
          What do you think needed to improve?
      # Commiting to local and updating the GitHub repo: 
            git add .
            git commit -m "[your comment]"
            git push origin [your module name]
  - Moving Modules to Master Branch and deploy :
